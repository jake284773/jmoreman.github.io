Ok, for some reason, today seemed like a great day to finally get this
composition recorded. I'm not sure whether I am completely happy with the final product. But as a first attempt at recording a song, I didn't think it was too bad.

The song is about the aftermath of a relationship breakup. I think the genre is most likely to be Piano Rock but I'm not 100% sure. I've never been good at genre identification - particularly for my own work as well.

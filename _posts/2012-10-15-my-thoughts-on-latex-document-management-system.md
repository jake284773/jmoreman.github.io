Recently, I have taken the step to use the document markup language LaTeX as my main tool for writing all of my formal documents. These mainly consist of assignments for my college course I am currently undertaking. The main reasons for doing this were to escape from Microsoft Word and allow me to write all my documents in plain text. The latter being very useful for allowing me to use source code revision management programs. (More on that later.)

As I first started to use LaTeX, one thing I did notice was how the documents that were generated always had a consistantly clean appearance. No longer did I need to worry about having to adjust the style or layout of the document to meet the formal requirements of the documents I needed to produce (like in Microsoft Word). So, in that way, the level of productivity for the initial production of each document was noticeable better.

So all in all, I think it was worthwhile using LaTeX in place of a standard graphical word processor. Obviously there are disadvantages of using it which I'll probably explain in another post. I realise that this isn't really much of a thorough post on this topic but I guess it was more of the basic key points I initially thought of when first getting to use it.

Time for me to release another cover of a song, but this time I've now given the whole process a complete revamp with regards to the recording
equipment. From the upgrade in equipment, there is a noticeable improvement in both audio and video quality. Below is the finished result:

However, as for the actual music performance, it could be better. In particular the vocals. I probably could have projected my voice a bit better but nevermind. I'll just bare that in mind for future recordings.

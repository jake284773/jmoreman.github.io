title: Smart Punctuation on GitHub Pages
---


As part of my blog redesign and migration to GitHub pages I found out that you can enable **SmartyPants** -- an extension for Markdown which formats punctuation marks properly for you.

Things that it can do include:

- Quotation marks: `""` and `''` into curly quotes.
- Dashes: `--` and `---` into en and em dashes.
- Elipses: From three consecutive dots `...`.

I find this incredibly useful and convenient as it means I don't have to fiddle about finding the appropriate HTML characters in order to make the text look better.

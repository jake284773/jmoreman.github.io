Over the past month or so I've been trying to migrate to the Samsung Chromebook for most of my activities. And although it has it's limitations it is surprisingly effective for all my productive tasks. Here's just an overview on how I've managed to make it my main computer.

### Software Development

I spend a fair deal of my time doing programming so it was important for me to see if I could have a productive workflow on the Chromebook. My first port of call was to see if the cloud based development IDEs fitted my needs.

- **Cloud9** - Probably one of the most well known IDEs available. The first thing becomes apparent is how beautiful the interface is.

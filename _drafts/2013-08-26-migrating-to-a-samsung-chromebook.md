title: Migrating to a Samsung Chromebook

Over the past month or so I've been trying to migrate to the Samsung Chromebook for most of my activities. And although it has it's limitations it is surprisingly effective for all my productive tasks. Here's just an overview on how I've managed to make it my main computer.

### Software Development

I spend a fair deal of my time doing programming so it was important for me to see if I could have a productive workflow on the Chromebook. My first port of call was to see if the cloud based development IDEs fitted my needs.

- **Cloud9** - Probably one of the most well known IDEs available. The first thing becomes apparent is how beautiful the interface is. That aside though, it's the usefulness that is the most important thing. The editor has many features and is quite comparable to most code editors such as Sublime Text 2. Another feature that it boasts is an integrated terminal running in a sandboxed Linux environment. This sort of thing is very important to me because my environment requires the use of a terminal.

   Upon reviewing all of these features it would seem it has all the features I need. However in practice they weren't that sweet. There's certainly a lot of things that need to be ironed out.

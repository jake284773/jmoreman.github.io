title: Smart Punctuation on GitHub Pages
---


As part of my blog redesign and migration to GitHub pages I found out that you can enable **SmartyPants** -- an extension for Markdown which formats punctuation marks properly for you.

Things that it can do include:

- Quotation marks -- `""` to "" and `''` to ''.
- Dashes -- `--` to -- and `---` to ----.
- Elipses from three consecutive dots -- `...` to ...
